1. Project Introduction & Setup
Description
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Airbnb open dataset for New York City. The goal is to uncover insights into pricing, availability, and popular neighborhoods. We begin by importing the necessary Python libraries for data manipulation (pandas, numpy) and visualization (matplotlib, seaborn).

Code
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Set the style for our plots
sns.set(style="whitegrid")
print("Libraries imported successfully!")
